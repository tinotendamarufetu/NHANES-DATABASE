# NHANES-DATABASE
This project aims to create a local PostgreSQL database for NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data. The NHANES dataset consists of various sections, including demographics, dietary information, laboratory data, examination data, and questionnaire responses. Each section will be represented by a separate schema.
